# Recipe Browser System (RBS)

Academic Project created for CSC214-401 Computer Science III at DTCC for the Fall Semester.

DESCRIPTION:
RBS is a web application designed for the distribution of recipes. Users can create an account to become a customer of the RBS. Customers can favorite, like, and create their own recipes to be uploaded (locally) to the RBS.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the RBS was a collaborative project thought up of by Group 1 of the CSC214-401 class. This project allowed us to explore the world of web development and collaborative work.
