   “name”: "Hazelnut French Macarons",
   “description”: "The ol classic hazelnut french macarons.",
   “ingredients”: ["Almond flour", "Confectioners' sugar", "Egg whites", "Superfine sugar", "Salt", "Buttercream (butter, confectioners sugar, whipping cream, vanilla extract, salt)"],
   “instruction”: ["Use a kitchen scale to measure out the ingredients. Macarons require precise measurements, and a scale ensures you’ll get all the right proportions. Once your ingredients are measured, pulse the almond flour and 3 tablespoons of confectioners’ sugar together until very fine. Then pass the mixture through a fine mesh sieve and get rid of any large pieces that remain. This may seem like overkill, but a fine texture is essential. Even fine almond flour will have large bits in it. Pulsing in the food processor and sifting will lighten the mix and remove any chunks.", "Next, get out your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Make sure the bowl and the whisk are squeaky clean for success with this step. 
       Add the egg whites and salt to the bowl and whisk on medium-low speed until frothy. Then slowly add the superfine sugar. Take your time; this process will take about 2 minutes. Add in the remaining confectioners’ sugar and bump up the speed to high. Whisk until the meringue is glossy and stiff peaks form—about another 2 to 3 minutes.", "Add your meringue into a large, wide-mouthed bowl. You’ll need the space. Add in about a third of the almond flour mixture into the meringue and fold lightly. Start at the outside, scrape along the bottom of the bowl towards you with a flexible spatula, continue up the side and scoop the mixture over the top. When that first bit of almond flour is well incorporated, add in the next third of the flour mixture and then the last third.
        As you work, turn the bowl and just continue to work slowly and carefully starting along the outside of the bowl. You do not want to deflate the egg whites! Egg whites give these cookies their signature texture.", "Take your cookie sheet outfitted with a pastry mat (with the outlines already marked) or parchment paper and start piping. Keep the bag and the tip perpendicular to the cookie sheet. Keeping this posture is critical for evenly shaped macarons. If you don’t have a pastry mat with the outlines already marked, you can draw your own template onto a sheet of parchment. Macarons are generally about 1-1/2 to 2 inches across, so break out that kitchen ruler and get tracing. If you need a guide, trace around the lip of a shot glass; it’s the perfect size.",
       "With your cookies perfectly piped, give the cookie sheet a tap on the counter to release any air bubbles inside the batter. If you notice any remaining large air bubbles, you can pop them carefully with a toothpick. Then walk away. Once they’re piped it’s important to let them sit so they can form a shell."],
